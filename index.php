			<blockquote>Also known as triticum spelta, spelt is a tasty whole grain with a nutty flavour. This distant cousin of wheat contains gluten and is therefore not suitable for those who have gluten intolerance, though it does tend to be easier to digest than wheat and may be better tolerated by those who have wheat sensitivity.
